# Omniauth::Tcs

TCS OAuth2 strategy for OmniAuth 1.x and supports the OAuth 2.0 server-side flow.
 
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "omniauth-tcs", git: "https://github.com/tcssoftware/omniauth-tcs"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

OmniAuth::Strategies::Tcs is simply a Rack middleware. Read the OmniAuth 1.0 docs for detailed instructions: https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth.

Here's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in config/initializers/omniauth.rb:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :tcs, ENV['TCS_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['TCS_CLIENT_SECRET']
end
```

## Configuration

Currently, there is only one configuration option that needs to be set:

* `scope`: A comma-separated list of permissions you want to request from the user. The currently available permissions are `public` and `write`.  

As new services are added the scopes will be updated.  Default: `public`

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :tcs, ENV['TCS_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['TCS_CLIENT_SECRET'], :scope => 'user_info,events'
end
```
